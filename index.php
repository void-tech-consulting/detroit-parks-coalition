    <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
    <h2>The Detroit Parks Coalition (DPC) is an alliance of organizations that connect Detroiters
      to beautiful, healthy, and well-maintained parks & public spaces.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our coalition was formed in 2019, when five parks organizations came together to share resources and learning.
      Since then, we have more than doubled our membership and strengthened our relationships with partners such as the City of Detroit,
      Huron-Clinton Metroparks Authority, and Wayne County Parks. Today, we are poised to increase resources to all parks 
      in Detroit and ensure that they are equitably distributed.
      <br>
      <br>
    <p>As we grow, we hope to share knowledge, solve problems together, advocate for parks citywide,
      and ultimately foster strong and supportive relationships among the City,
      park stewardship groups, residents, park users, and partners.</p>
