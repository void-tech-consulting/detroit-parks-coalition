      <div class="mission1">
      <p>Our coalition was formed in 2019, when five parks organizations came together to share resources and learning.
        Since then, we have more than doubled our membership and strengthened our relationships with partners suchas the City of Detroist,
        Huron-Clinton metroparks Authroity, and Wayne County Parks. Today,
        we are poised to increase resources to all parks in Detroit and ensure that they are equitably distributed.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="mission2">
      <p>As we grow, we hope to share knowledge, solve problems together, advocate for parks citywide,
        and ultimately foster strong and supportive relationships among the CIty, park stewardship groups, residents, park users, and partners.</p>
